# what_makes_a\_data_analyst

A small project to see what I want to keep in my CV applying for Data Analyst jobs. Or indeed any kind of jobs.

The project is motivated by a scenrio where the applicant wants to speculatively submit a CV to recruiters and recruiting agencies. This is straightforward only until the complete CV ends up taking multiple pages, and it becomes important to know what is least important. At project outset I suspect that this might be of particular importance when deciding what "soft skills" are worth highlighting.

The plan is simple. API to databases containing job adverts and then use that information to compose a list of most needed requirements. With that it is possible to start working out what can get cut out from a CV to make it a good fit for recruiters.

The project uses a combination of R to do the API connections and analytics, alongside Python to connect to GPT 3.5 (which I am using to get the keywords out of the job descriptions).

The repository contains both the information on how to do the API call, including changing some of the filters, as well as the files containing processed data, if you want to do your own explorations.

Files/folders summary:

-   average_data_analyst.qmd: the Quarto file containing *all* the analytics.
